Ionic ES6 ready starter project
=====================

This is a really simple implementation of the Ionic tabs starter project in ES6/Browserify.

Simply edit the files in /js and call `gulp js` or `gulp watch`.


## ToDos

Honestly, loads needs to be done. Tests, best gulp watching, cleanups...

I'll probably update this project in a couple months next time I need to use it as a template for an app. However, any pull requests in the meantime would be greatly appreciated.
